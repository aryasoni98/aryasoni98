## How to Contribute to Open Source ? | What? Why?

## What do you mean by open-source contribution?

Open-Source Software is a type of software whose code is publicly available to use and modify. Open-Source Contribution involves contributing to the development or improvement of open-source software.

Some popular Open-Source Software are the Linux Operating System, Android, Mozilla Firefox, Chromium (which powers Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge), VSCode IDE, VLC Media Player, WordPress Content Manager System, etc.

## Why should I contribute to open-source?

Ever wonder if all these projects/software were single-handedly maintained by a single developer?
What would have been its impact on them and pretty much on us?

The software would not have had so many features and upgradations. This is where open source contribution comes in. Contributors from around the world help develop and improve the software for every one of us who use it. Being a contributor will give you the super-power to be a part of something that is impacting so many lives.

## Prerequisites before starting to contribute

### Learn a programming language

Since open-source contribution requires you to read/write code if you want to be involved in its development, you are required to learn a programming language to get started. You can get started with any language of your choice. You can easily learn another language at a later stage if a project requires it.

## Get Familiar with Version Control Systems (VCS)

When we are working on a big project, it is extremely important to store all the changes that are being made to recall it at a later stage. Version Control Systems are software tools that help with it. They keep track of all the modifications that happen over time in the source code as versions. They also allow us to go through older versions and revert to an old version if required.

There are many version control systems such as Git, Mercurial, CVS, and SVN. Git is the most popular and most widely used version control system in the industry.

## Git

Git is the most popular open-source distributed VCS used with most commercial and non-commercial projects.

In the initial stages, this cheat sheet might be very handy: [GIT CHEAT SHEET](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

## GitHub

GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration using the Git Version Control System. In laymanâ€™s term, it is the place where you keep all your projects and multiple people can work together on those projects.

Good resources to get started with GitHub:

- [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com)
- [Git & GitHub Crash Course For Beginners - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)
- [Git and GitHub crash course from FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)

Note that you do not need to be a master in VCS/Git/GitHub to start contributing. Once you are comfortable with the basics, you can start contributing to open-source.

## How to get started with open-source contribution?

### Open Source your projects

If you have already done some projects, open-sourcing your projects might be a good way to get started. Put it on GitHub and seek contributions from the community. This will not only add value to your project but will also help you to collaborate with many developers around the world.

Many widely-used frameworks and libraries were open-sourced by individual developers. Several people started collaborating and maintaining these projects after the projects got popular.
